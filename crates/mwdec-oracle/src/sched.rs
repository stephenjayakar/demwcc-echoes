//! The real list scheduler, observed: per basic block the dependence DAG GC/2.7 built (with
//! latencies, heights, deadlines) and the sequence of picks (cycle, instruction), recorded by the
//! tracer (`TraceOptions::sched`). This module replays the pick rule on that data to say *why* each
//! instruction was issued where it was, and answers "why is X before Y" questions:
//! - a dependence path from X to Y (data / memory / anti / output / ordering edge): no source
//!   reordering can swap them;
//! - Y was not ready when X issued (a predecessor or a latency held it back);
//! - both were ready and the pick rule chose X: deadline (urgency), number of successors uncovered,
//!   height (longest path to the block end), opcode rank (pre-RA only), or **program order**: only
//!   in that last case does the order of the source statements decide.
//!
//! Pick rule (GC/2.7 `select_ready_coloring_node` `0x507e70`): scan ready nodes in program order;
//! the first is the pick; a later candidate replaces it if it is urgent (deadline <= cycle) and the
//! pick is not; an urgent pick is never replaced by a non-urgent one; otherwise the candidate wins
//! with more uncovered successors, else greater height, else (pre-RA only) strictly lower opcode rank.
